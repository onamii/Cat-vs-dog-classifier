 The notebook presents visualizations of training loss (series of dots) and validation loss (continuous line) throughout the training epochs.
Accuracy and Loss: The accuracy and loss of the evaluation on the testing set are presented numerically.
Any cat/dog picture can be provided to the model for prediction using .predict() to check whether the model recognizes it correctly.
